Summary

Students are introduced to the concept of air quality by investigating the composition, properties, atmospheric layers and everyday importance of air. They explore the sources and effects of visible and invisible air pollution. By learning some fundamental meteorology concepts (air pressure, barometers, prediction, convection currents, temperature inversions), students learn the impact of weather on air pollution control and prevention. Looking at models and maps, they explore the consequences of pollutant transport via weather and water cycles. Students are introduced to acids, bases and pH, and the environmental problem of acid rain, including how engineers address this type of pollution. Using simple models, they study the greenhouse effect, the impact of increased greenhouse gases on the planet's protective ozone layer and the global warming theory. Students explore the causes and effects of the Earth's ozone holes through an interactive simulation. Students identify the types and sources of indoor air pollutants in their school and home, evaluating actions that can be taken to reduce and prevent poor indoor air quality. By building and observing a few simple models of pollutant recovery methods, students explore the modern industrial technologies designed by engineers to clean up and prevent air pollution.

Engineering Connection

With the vast number of cars on our roads combined with the pollutant-emitting factories that are in use, further combined with the not-so-clean daily living habits of our Earth's inhabitants, air pollution is a huge concern for engineers. And, it is becoming an even bigger concern as we continue to learn more about the adverse health effects of poor air quality. Engineers investigate the source and effect of air pollution on people and their environment, and do their best to both prevent it *and* clean it up.

Engineers play a huge part in preventing smog and visible particulate matter pollution so our air is safe to breathe. And, engineers continue to explore new, creative ideas to actually lower the emissions into the air, such as designing more efficient vehicles and filters to reduce the amount of particulate matter released into the atmosphere. One of the biggest challenges engineers face is devising new techniques to prevent and reduce the creation of additional air pollution from manufacturing and industry of our modern world. Therefore, the modern engineer always keeps long-term sustainability in mind as a design objective.

Environmental and chemical engineers examine pollutants to determine the kind of impact it may have on human health and the environment. In response, engineers develop useful technologies to alleviate pollution sources, such as catalytic converters that remove certain poisonous gases from vehicle exhaust fumes. Other engineers re-design vehicles and factories to reduce the emissions that cause greenhouse gases. Others are working to change manufacturing processes, regulations and practices, in an effort to clean up many chemical sources.

So, engineers must be creative in designing new technologies that clean up and prevent air pollution so that we have a comfortable and safe environment in which to live. Thanks to engineers, we can breathe safely!
