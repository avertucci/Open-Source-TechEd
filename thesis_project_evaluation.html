                      Some of the most interesting things to come out of this project was not just the student outcomes but the actual overall educator outscomes.
                      Now you might be asking what do I exactly mean by that.
                      Well my question outcomes really focus around the student leanring outcomes from a collaborative learning experience between curriculum and lesson plans rather then that off information passed from teacher to student-teacher as in many cases is the case.
                      Laura Dabbish, Colleen Stuart, Jason Tsay, Jim Herbsleb from the School of Computer Science and Center for the Future of Work, Heinz College explain in their article "Social Coding in GitHub: Transparency and Collaborationin an Open Software Repository" that <b>"Social applications on the web let users track and follow the activities of a large number of others regardless of location or affiliation. There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex knowledge-based activities."</b>
                      To me, that message is so powerful and I encourage you to read the full reading <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/Web/People/xia/resources/Documents/cscw2012_Github-paper-FinalVersion-1.pdf">here</a>.
                      For educators, collaboration is a key component to empowering students with new and motivational learnings each and everyday. One of the big things behind OSTE is that very exact concept that GitHub is built on.
                      The software community has already taken in and accepted GitHub as that FREE social platform, why can't the education community with special consideration towards Technology Educators.

                      In a study within the <a href="http://alexeyza.com/pdf/cscw15.pdf">University of Victoria, BC, Canada GitHub was a main focus behind a study with educational collaboration.</a>
                      Some of the important questions asked, which in part were in parallel to OSTE's inception was can GitHub support learning and teaching? What is the motiviation of benfits of using GitHub? And lastly, What are those challenges for the educational field?
