                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The project itself can be broken down really into 2 main parts:<br>
                    1. The GitHub Repository<br>
                    2. The GitHub hosted Website (how you are viewing this page now)
                  </p>

                  <h4>The Repo</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Open Souce TechEd repo is the heart of the project. It is the holding area of curriculums, lesson plans, assessment material, and educational learning material. If not familiar with Github well this is where we need to start. GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. This is important to understand because every item that goes into the repository is version controlled adding a niche that no other project of this kind has within the educational domain of technology.
                  Any overall folder or idicual item of the repo can be worked on indiviudally, versioned and then brought back into the MASTER branch as seen fit. One thing to take into account as this develops is that currently only myself will be in charge of the main MASTER branch which is the final, production version of all items. Users are able to branch off to create items of their own or improve current items but PULL REQUESTS can only be approved currently by myself until moderators are added.<br>

                </p>

                <p>
                  Currently, the repository is housing a single 'Air Pullution' curriculum but is also currently in the process of exapnding to more curriculums by other educators and networking platforms that I have advertised to (Teach Engineering as one example). The Air Pollution curriculum in its final state will house over 50 lessson plans, each with supporting handouts and assessments for student progression. Think of this repository years from now with multitudes of learning documentation, also versioned in an unlimited storage envirnoment? The possabilties are endless with more people that it touches. For a user who does not want to contribute the repo can stil be easily downloaded as a zip folder and organized into lesson plans or curriculums to clearly indicated folder titles to look into that then provide support documentation. This will all also be identified in mark down readme files to provide simple clear instructions for new educators or those not familiar with GitHub.
                </p>

                  <h4>The Website</h4>
                <p>
                  The website is more of a front facing advertisement item for OSTE (Open Source technology Education). The website, fully hosted within the repository itself, is connected to provide front facing information and curriculum organization of the project progresses.
